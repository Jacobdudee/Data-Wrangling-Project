# Data-Wrangling-Project
This project was completed as part of my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. I cleaned Open Street Map XML data using Python, then loaded clean datasets into a SQLite database.

Data was obtained via MapZen, an Open Street Map API that allowed me to extract data in XML format from a custom square of lat/long points. I put the points around Whittier, CA, my hometown.

There are 2 main Jupyter notebooks for this project:

1. Open Street Map Project Notebook: contains sql queries from cleaned data and includes dicussion

2. OSM Time Series Analysis in Python: I analyzed contributions over time to this area using Pandas/Matplotlib

This repo also includes the Python scripts I used to wrangle the extracted XML data into a format suitable for analysis.
