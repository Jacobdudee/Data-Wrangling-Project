# Data-Wrangling-Project
This project was completed as part of my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. I cleaned Open Street Map XML data using Python, then loaded clean datasets into a SQLite database.

There are 2 notebooks for this project:

1. Project Notebook: contains sql queries from cleaned data and includes dicussion

2. Time Series Analysis in Python: I analyzed contributions over time to this area using Pandas/Matplotlib

This repo also includes the Python scripts I used to wrangle the extracted XML data into a format suitable for analysis.
